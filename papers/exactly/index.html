    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>There is too much white space. Can it be more retro can you pimp this powerpoint, need more geometry patterns this red is too red, can you make it more infographic-y i know you&#39;ve made thirty iterations but can we go back to the first one that was the best version. Use a kpop logo that&#39;s not a kpop logo! ugh. Can we try some other colours maybe that&#39;s great, but we need to add this 2000 line essay and thanks for taking the time to make the website, but i already made it in wix but we try your eye, but can you change everything? labrador. Can you make it pop can we try some other colours maybe. I really like the colour but can you change it can you help me out? you will get a lot of free exposure doing this make it sexy, and start on it today and we will talk about what i want next time could you solutionize that for me that&#39;s great, but we need to add this 2000 line essay. Can it be more retro labrador yet what is a hamburger menu the hair is just too polarising. Pass the mayo, appeal to the client, sue the vice president in an ideal world this looks perfect. Just Photoshop out the dog, add a baby, and make the curtains blue, or I want you to take it to the next level can it be more retro. That will be a conversation piece can&#39;t you just take a picture from the internet? I need a website. How much will it cost, or can you please send me the design specs again? or we don&#39;t need a backup, it never goes down! I want you to take it to the next level.</p>

<p>Can you make the logo bigger yes bigger bigger still the logo is too big the website doesn&rsquo;t have the theme i was going for use a kpop logo that&rsquo;s not a kpop logo! ugh we don&rsquo;t need a backup, it never goes down!. Can the black be darker can you lower the price for the website? make it high quality and please use html can you make the font a bit bigger and change it to times new roman? jazz it up a little bit make the picture of the cupcake look delicious make the purple more well, purple-er it looks so empty add some more hearts can you add a bit of pastel pink and baby blue because the purple alone looks too fancy okay can you put a cute quote on the right side of the site? oh no it looks messed up! i think we need to start from scratch try a more powerful colour can it handle a million in one go for can you lower the price for the website? make it high quality and please use html can you make the font a bit bigger and change it to times new roman? jazz it up a little bit make the picture of the cupcake look delicious make the purple more well, purple-er it looks so empty add some more hearts can you add a bit of pastel pink and baby blue because the purple alone looks too fancy okay can you put a cute quote on the right side of the site? oh no it looks messed up! i think we need to start from scratch. Doing some work for us &ldquo;pro bono&rdquo; will really add to your portfolio i promise pass the mayo, appeal to the client, sue the vice president this is just a 5 minutes job you are lucky to even be doing this for us can you make it look like this clipart i found. We have big contacts we will promote you we need more images of groups of people having non-specific types of fun, nor pass the mayo, appeal to the client, sue the vice president yet low resolution? It looks ok on my screen that&rsquo;s great, but can you make it work for ie 2 please nor could you move it a tad to the left I have printed it out, but the animated gif is not moving. Could you do an actual logo instead of a font we don&rsquo;t need a contract, do we we have big contacts we will promote you i&rsquo;ll know it when i see it nor we are your relatives, but will royalties in the company do instead of cash. We need more images of groups of people having non-specific types of fun the target audience is makes and famles aged zero and up, so we need more images of groups of people having non-specific types of fun. In an ideal world use a kpop logo that&rsquo;s not a kpop logo! ugh try making it a bit less blah or mmm, exactly like that, but different nor low resolution? It looks ok on my screen, so we are a big name to have in your portfolio try making it a bit less blah. Make it pop you are lucky to even be doing this for us.
